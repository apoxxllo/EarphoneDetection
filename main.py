    **Problem Overview**: The customer requested help with their laptop, but provided no specific details about the issue.
    **Image Details**: No image was provided.
    **Key Steps Taken**: The agent likely asked clarifying questions about the issue with the laptop.
    **Resolution Details**: The ticket was likely resolved through a combination of clarifying questions and troubleshooting steps. The customer's final message, "wa pa nahuman," suggests they were satisfied with the assistance provided.
